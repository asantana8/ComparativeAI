# Roulette Game

## Description
This project is a simple implementation of a roulette game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a spinning roulette wheel and a ball that bounces around the wheel before coming to a stop, simulating the physics of a real roulette game.

## Files Overview

- **index.html**: This file sets up the structure of the roulette game. It includes a canvas element for rendering the roulette wheel and the ball, along with links to the CSS and JavaScript files.

- **css/style.css**: This file contains the styles for the roulette game, defining the appearance of the canvas, the roulette wheel, the ball, and other UI elements.

- **js/app.js**: This file implements the game logic. It initializes the canvas, draws the roulette wheel and ball, handles the rotation of the wheel, and simulates the physics of the ball bouncing and coming to a stop.

## How to Run the Game
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Enjoy playing the roulette game!

## Game Mechanics
- The roulette wheel spins at a certain speed, and the ball is released to bounce around the wheel.
- The ball follows the laws of physics, gradually slowing down until it comes to a stop in one of the numbered slots on the wheel.
- Players can place bets on where they think the ball will land.
